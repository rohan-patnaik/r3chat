# R3Chat - Product Requirements Document 

## 1. Product Vision & Goal

R3Chat is a fast, beautiful, and privacy-respecting AI chat web application. It aims to provide a seamless and highly performant user experience for interacting with various large language models, with a focus on developer and data scientist workflows.

## 2. Key Features & Scope

### 2.1. Theming & UI
*   **Color Palette:** (Will be updated with specific brown-based colors)
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout should be optimized for desktop use.
*   **Dual Theme Support:** Dark and light brown themes.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Sun/moon icon on the top-right of the chat space.

### 2.2. Authentication
*   **Provider:** Google OAuth via Supabase Auth.
*   **Flow:**
    *   Unauthenticated users are redirected to a `/login` page.
    *   Successful login redirects users to the main chat interface.
    *   A logout button will be available to end the session.
*   **Security:** All data-access routes will be protected.

### 2.3. Conversation Management (CRUD)
*   **List Conversations:** Users can see a list of all their past conversations in a sidebar, grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, etc.).
*   **Create Conversation (Deferred Model):**
    *   Clicking "New Chat" will instantly present a clean slate for a new conversation without any delay.
    *   The conversation record is only created in the database *after* the user sends their first message and receives a response.
*   **Update Conversation:**
    *   The conversation title will be automatically generated by the LLM based on the first user message (4 words or less).
    *   Users will be able to manually rename conversations.
*   **Delete Conversation:** Users can delete conversations they no longer need.

### 2.4. Messaging & Freemium Model
*   **Send/Receive:** Users can send messages and receive responses from the selected AI model.
*   **Streaming:** AI responses are streamed token-by-token for a real-time feel.
*   **Model Selection:** Users can select from a list of available models. Non-freemium models are disabled for guest users.
*   **Credit System:** New users automatically receive 10 credits. Each message costs 1 credit. The UI displays the remaining credits in real-time.

### 2.5. Settings & Profile Management
*   **API Key Management:** Users can securely add and manage their API keys for different AI providers to bypass the credit system.
*   **Profile Editing:** Users can edit their display name and upload an avatar.
*   **Subscription Management:** Link to a placeholder credit card page.
*   **Message Usage Tracking:** Panel with progress bars (Standard: 10, Premium: 5).

## 3. Technical Stack
*   **Framework:** Next.js 15+ (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel

## 4. Out of Scope (for v1)
*   Team collaboration features
*   Actual payment processing for subscriptions.
*   Advanced admin dashboards (beyond profile management).

## Prompt: UI Design Fixes and Improvements

### Context
All errors in the application have been resolved, but recent UI changes have broken the design. The UI elements need to be adjusted to ensure a visually pleasing and consistent appearance across the app.

### Tasks

1. **General UI Improvements**
    - Adjust spacing between all UI elements (text, headings, buttons, etc.) for a clean and beautiful layout.
    - Ensure all elements fit well and are visually pleasing.

2. **Sidebar**
    - Replace the sidebar open/close icon with a hamburger icon at the top left of the page.
    - Move the User Profile section to the bottom of the sidebar, displaying the Google ID image as the profile picture.

3. **Settings and Theme Icons**
    - Place these icons at the top left.
    - Add a subtle, translucent, contrasting shadow on hover.
    - This should work for both light and dark themes.

4. **Section Headers**
    - For "Today", "Yesterday", "ThisWeek", "Older":
        - Use a smaller, thinner font.
        - Left-align as small headers in appropriate locations.

5. **Chatbox**
    - Make the chatbox taller and slightly translucent for background visibility.
    - At the bottom part of the chatbox, add:
        - Model dropdown
        - Attachment icon
        - "Go" button icon (aligned to the far right)
    - Refer to the 6th attached image for reference.
    - The text written in the chatbox should not be above this bottom part so it does not hinder visibility for user.

6. **Settings Page Sections**
    - **Account Section:** Improve aesthetics and spacing.
    - **Models Section:** Apply better spacing and design (see 7th image for reference to what is needed; 8th image shows current state).
    - **API Keys Section:** Apply the same design principles (see 9th image for current state).
    - **Usage Section:** Apply the same design principles (see 10th image for current state).

### Rendering Requirements

- **Code:** Display all code in proper code snippet blocks.
- **Math/LaTeX:** Render all math formulas and LaTeX appropriately.
- Think and take care of other rendering issues while the response generates.

### Deliverables

- List all assumptions made.
- Describe the approach and specific changes you will make.
- After implementing the above, review the PRD and list any remaining tasks.
- Do not break any existing functionality.

### References

- Use the attached images for visual reference of the current and desired UI states.
